// A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

// When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.

// A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.

// Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

// Search
let txt = "Hii Shashwat";
let n = txt.search(/sHashwat/i);
console.log(n);

// Replace
// It is same process but we can replace items in it.
// Regular expressions can make your search much more powerful (case insensitive)
