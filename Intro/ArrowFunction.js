// Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.

// Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

let myFunction = (a, b) => a * b;
hello = ()=>{
    return  "Hello WOrld";
}
console.log(hello());

// Note: This works only if the function has only one statement

// With arrow functions the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.
