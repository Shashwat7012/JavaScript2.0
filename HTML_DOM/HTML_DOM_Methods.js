// // HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).

// // HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.

// The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).

// In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.

// The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.

// A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).

// A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).

// index.html..................

setTimeout(myFunction,2000);
function myFunction(){
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hii Shashwat";
}
// In the example above, getElementById is a method, while innerHTML is a property.
// The most common way to access an HTML element is to use the id of the element.

// In the example above the getElementById method used id="demo" to find the element.
